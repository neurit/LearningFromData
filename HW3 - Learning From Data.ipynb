    "A. The logic of the solution relies on colinear/coplanar points necessarily existing in certain spaces, but being impossible to shatter without an added dimension. We start with $\\mathbb{R}^1$ and use the same reasoning for higher dimensions. \n",
    "\n",
    "2 points can be shattered by either placing the 1d \"hyperplane\" (a point) to the right of both points, in between the points or to the left of both points. 3 points, however, cannot be seperated as the configuration with the outer points being labeled differently from the one in between them is impossible. So the min break point is 3. \n",
    "\n",
    "In $\\mathbb{R}^2$, the same 3 points can be seperated if one takes the middle point and moves it into the newly added 2nd dimension, out of the line that goes through the outer points. The remaining cases similarly follow from a symmetric argument, i.e., as long as the points are not all colinear they can be seperated, so 3 points can be shattered. With 4 points, there is a problem of the same nature as with 3 points in $R^1$. Consider the pair of intersecting lines that run through two points each: this configuration will always exist (if the two lines are parellel, swap the points that determine the lines), and it is impossible to label the two points on each of these lines differently. So the min break point is $4$. \n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, in $\\mathbb{R}^3$, the same 4 points can be seperated if one takes two points that lie on one of the intersecting lines and moves it into the newly added 3rd dimension so that the lines are askew. More generally, take the 3 points that can be shattered in $R^2$, which determine a plane, and choose the 4th point such that it is not in that plane. Then any 3-subset of the 4 points determine a line, with the remaining 4th point not coplanar, such that the problem reduces down to 3 points in $R^2$ plus trivially drawing a parellel plane between the remaning 4th point. \n",
    "\n",
    "5 points, however, cannot be. As before, the abstract problem involves \"outer\" points and \"inner\" points not being able to seperated because they are restricted to $\\mathbb{R}^3$ (and the problem would be remedied by adding another dimension and considering them as not all lying in the same 4d hyperplane). Consider a 3-subset of the 5 points that determine a plane such that the remaining two points (on either side of the plane) determine a line that intersects that plane (and again, if the line and plane are parellel, swap the points that determine each; because of the space restriction to $R^3$, it is always possible to get this configuration). Then it would be impossible to split both points of the line plus a non-colinear one of the plane, from the remanining two points on the plane. Thus the min breakpoint is 5. \n",
